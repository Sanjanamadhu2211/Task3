# Task3
In this task, I implemented simple and multiple linear regression using the Housing Price Prediction dataset. The data was preprocessed with one-hot encoding, then split into training and test sets. I trained a linear regression model, evaluated it using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score, and interpreted the learned coefficients. For a single feature, a regression line was plotted to visualize the model fit.

Tools Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib -> for plotting
- Scikit-learn -> for model training, evaluation, and data splitting
